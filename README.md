# SpeechSets

A web app that generates lists of words and phrases for use in speech therapy. 

Many older adults face health conditions that can affect their speech, yet existing speech therapy apps and websites are designed to appeal to kids, with cartoonish pictures and childish vocabularies. This web app allows speech therapists and their patients to instantly create large sets of words for speech practice, and tailor them based on the needs and interests of older adults.
